Haskell Heist is a lot faster with compiled Haskell
 
Case 1. Templating with no database, but templates read from File

./test daniel
real    0m0.007s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.004s

ruby ruby-test.rb
real    0m0.167s
user    0m0.016s
sys     0m0.020s

time runghc test.hs  test
real    0m0.329s
user    0m0.284s
sys     0m0.032s


Case 2. With Database Access

compiled haskell
./testdb
real    0m0.028s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.012s

runghc testdb.hs
real    0m0.446s
user    0m0.392s
sys     0m0.032s

ruby ruby-testdb.rb
real    0m0.310s
user    0m0.160s
sys     0m0.016s




Haskell is fast. We can even put pagination markup at the bottom of the
results.
